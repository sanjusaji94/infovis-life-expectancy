## Overview
This project is an interactive web-based visualization that explores **global life expectancy across countries from 2000 to 2015**.  
The dashboard enables users to analyze temporal trends, compare countries, and examine the relationship between life expectancy and economic indicators.

The project was developed as part of **Group Assignment 2 (Interactive Visualization Project)** for the *Information Visualization* course.

---

## Research Questions
- How has life expectancy changed over time for different countries?
- How does life expectancy vary across countries in a given year?
- What is the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy?
- How is life expectancy distributed across countries in a selected year?

---

## Visualizations
The dashboard consists of four coordinated views:

1. **Line Chart**  
   Life expectancy trend over time for a selected country.

2. **Bar Chart**  
   Top 10 countries by life expectancy for the selected year.

3. **Scatter Plot**  
   GDP per capita vs. life expectancy across all countries in the selected year.

4. **Histogram**  
   Distribution of life expectancy values across countries for the selected year.
